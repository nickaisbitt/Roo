# Token Bridge Service Configuration
# This configuration is for integrating with an EXTERNAL bridge service
# The bridge service should be deployed separately (e.g., on Railway)

# ========================================
# MAIN APPLICATION CONFIGURATION
# ========================================
# These variables should be set in your main application

# External Bridge Service URL (REQUIRED)
# Set this to your deployed bridge service URL
TOKEN_BRIDGE_URL=https://your-bridge-service.up.railway.app

# Bridge Authentication Secret (REQUIRED)
# This must match the BRIDGE_SECRET used by your external bridge service
BRIDGE_SECRET=your_strong_random_secret_key

# ========================================  
# EXTERNAL BRIDGE SERVICE CONFIGURATION
# ========================================
# These variables should be set in your SEPARATE bridge service deployment
# (You'll configure these in Railway/Heroku/etc. for your bridge service)

# Spreaker OAuth App Credentials (REQUIRED for bridge service)
# SPREAKER_CLIENT_ID=your_spreaker_client_id
# SPREAKER_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spreaker_client_secret
# SPREAKER_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_current_refresh_token

# Bridge Service Settings (OPTIONAL for bridge service)  
# BRIDGE_PORT=5000
# NODE_ENV=production

# ========================================
# NOTES
# ========================================
# 1. The main application only needs TOKEN_BRIDGE_URL and BRIDGE_SECRET
# 2. The bridge service deployment needs the Spreaker credentials
# 3. Both services must use the same BRIDGE_SECRET value
# 4. Keep the bridge secret secure and use different values per environment
